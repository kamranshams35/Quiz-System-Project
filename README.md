# Quiz-System-Project
A Quiz System in OOP uses classes like Quiz (for creating quizzes), Question (managing question details), User (handling participants), and Answer (storing responses). The QuizManager class coordinates interactions, ensuring quizzes are structured, user-friendly, and easily adaptable for adding new features or modifying existing ones.
